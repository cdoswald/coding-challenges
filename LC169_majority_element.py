Challenge: LeetCode #169 - Majority Element
Description:
    Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

    The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. 
    You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [3,2,3]
    Output: 3
    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
    Output: 2

        return sorted(counter_dict, key=counter_dict.get, reverse=True)[0]
